# Automate Benthic Surveying using Python

An automation solution using python on the Benthic Surveying problem. Inspired from my brother's school assignment.

### Problem Overview:

- The task involves determining the accuracy and precision of Small and Large Quadrats in Small and Large Inference Spaces while using completely Random and Systematic Random Sampling in a Clumped Distribution of corals.
- The researchers manually places the quadrats in an Excel sheet.
- The problem is to find a more efficient and faster way of doing this.

### Solution

- To create a python program that automates this process.
  - User will be able to:
    - Upload an image file and let the program detect corals in an inference space.
    - Write the data into a `.csv` file.
